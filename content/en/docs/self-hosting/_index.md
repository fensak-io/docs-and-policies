We currently do not officially support running a self-hosted instance of Fensak. What this means is that we do not
make any guarantees, provide official support, or documentation about how to run a self-hosted version of Fensak.

However, as long as you comply with [the licensing terms](https://github.com/fensak-io/fensak/#license) of Fensak, there
is nothing stopping you from running a self-hosted version of Fensak.

In other words, you are free to set up a self-hosted instance of Fensak as long as you comply with the specific license
you are licensing Fensak under, and if you can set it up on your own without our help.

This may change in the future as there is more demand for such implementations.

> Refer to the [License FAQ](/docs/license-faq) to learn more about the licenses that Fensak employ.
