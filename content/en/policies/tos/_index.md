*Last updated: Oct 13th, 2023*

Thank you for using Fensak! This Terms of Service applies to the Fensak Service and related GitHub app.

When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Fensak, LLC.

When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that have installed the Fensak app.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes [on
GitHub](https://github.com/fensak-io/docs-and-policies/commits/main/content/en/policies/tos/_index.md). Whenever we make
a significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the top of this page and take any other appropriate
steps to notify account holders.

When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That’s true for any of
our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do
not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or
provision. **These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.**

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place
a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about our
[policies](https://github.com/fensak-io/docs-and-policies) and keeping an open door to [your
feedback](https://github.com/orgs/fensak-io/discussions).

## Account Terms

1. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be
   liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

2. You are responsible for all content provided to our Service via GitHub and activity that occurs under your account.
   That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own
   logins under your account.

3. You may not use our Service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

4. You may not attempt to break into our Services by attempting to escape the interpreter sandbox through the rules
   engine unless you have explicit written approval from us, such as through an authorized Penetration Test. Such
   unauthorized attempts will result in an immediate termination of your account.

## Payment, Plan Changes, Usage, and No Refunds

1. For our free trial, we explain the length of trial and included services when you sign up. After the trial period,
   your Billing Account will automatically be billed the subscription charge by Our Merchant of Record
   ([Paddle](https://paddle.com)).

2. We offer multiple paid plans with differing feature sets and payment cycles. Each paid plan is a recurring monthly or
   annual subscription that provides access to the core features of the Service. The feature sets of each plan are
   described in [the pricing table](https://fensak.io/#pricing).

3. Each paid plan includes a limit on the number of repositories that will be monitored, as described in [the pricing
   table](https://fensak.io/#pricing). Any configuration that exceeds this limit will be rejected by the system and you
   will not be able to use the Service until the number of repos in the configuration is reduced. For any plan that
   allows multiple GitHub Organizations, the repository limit is cumulative across all associated GitHub Organizations.

4. Our payment process is conducted by our Merchant of Record ([Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/)). All fees are
   inclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Paddle will collect those taxes on behalf of
   the taxing authorities and remit those taxes to them. All charges will originate from Paddle and will show as
   `PADDLE.NET* FENSAKLLC` on your bank/card statement. See [Paddle's Terms of
   Service](https://www.paddle.com/legal/terms) for more details.

5. All purchases are final and non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service,
   downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account.

## Cancellation and Termination

1. You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. We provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation
   link from your account settings page on our [dashboard service](https://dash.fensak.io). You can find instructions
   for how to cancel your account in our documentation. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not
   automatically considered cancellation. If you need help cancelling your account, you can always [contact
   us](mailto:support@fensak.io).

2. Account cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing cycle, unless you are cancelling during the free
   trial period, in which case cancellation takes effect at the end of the trial period. You will lose access to our
   Services when the cancellation takes effect. Our Services will no longer monitor or issue checks on your pull
   requests. Your data will be deleted at the time you uninstall our GitHub App from your GitHub Organization.

3. We have the right to terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any
   reason at any time. Termination will result in immediate loss of access to our Services. We also reserve the right to
   refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically
   speaking, out of the accounts on our Services, there may be at least one doing something nefarious.

8. Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of Company employees, officers,
   contractors, or affiliates will result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the Service and Prices

1. Any part of the Service may change or be discontinued with or without notice.

2. Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers
   from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at
   least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on
   our websites or the affected Services themselves.

## Uptime, Security, and Privacy

1. Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We
   do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services but do take uptime of our applications seriously.
   Visit [https://fensak.instatus.com/](https://fensak.instatus.com/) to see the status of our Service.

2. We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of
   other customers of the Service. Of course, we’ll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in
   rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.

3. We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce
   encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. We store all your data encrypted at rest. There
   are some edge cases where we may send your data through our internal network unencrypted. Please report a security
   incident or threat to [security@fensak.io](mailto:security@fensak.io).

4. When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Fensak may
   process your data as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.fensak.io/policies/privacy) and for no other
   purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:

   1. **To help you with support requests you make.** We’ll ask for express consent before accessing your account.

   2. **On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.** We get automated
      alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any
      personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In
      these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors from reoccurring.

   3. **To safeguard Fensak.** We’ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your
      data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse report
      investigation.

   4. **To the extent required by applicable law.** As a US company with data infrastructure located in the US, we
      only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or
      proper request under the Stored Communications Act. If a non-US authority approaches Fensak for assistance,
      our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to
      comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If
      Fensak is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete
      the audit.

5. We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and
   related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data for
   Fensak in our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.fensak.io/policies/privacy).

6. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Fensak is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third
   party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the
   purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms of Service and [Privacy
   policy](https://docs.fensak.io/policies/privacy). We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information
   for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. Reciprocally, you agree to comply
   with your requirements under the CCPA and not use Fensak’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.

7. Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union,
   UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States, **please be aware that any information you provide to us will be
   transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using our websites or Services and/or providing us with your
   personal information, you consent to this transfer.

## Features and Bugs

We reserve the right to change and remove features of our Services at any time. We design our Services with care, based
on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such
thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements
or expectations.

We test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have
some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or
privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free Services.

We do not take responsibility for any loses or damages resulting from bugs or misconfiguration of the Service.
Similarly, we do not take responsibility for the results of any and all rules scripts that you provide to the Service
and are executed on the Service. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any losses or damages directly or
indirectly resulting from errors in the Service and rules, including but not limited to accidental merges of destructive
changes to your infrastructure code.


## Support

Technical support is provided by [email](mailto:support@fenak.io) and [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/fensak-io/discussions). There is no Service Level Agreement on support inquiry
response time. Responses are provided on the reasonable effort basis without guaranteed response time.


## Copyright and Content Ownership

1. **We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Services.** All materials made
   accessible to us through GitHub remain yours.

2. We reserve the right (but not the obligation) at our sole discretion to refuse any content that is
   made available to the Service.

3. You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service or the Company.

4. "Fensak", the Fensak logo, and any other product or service name or slogan displayed on the Service are
   trademarks of the company and may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written
   permission of the company or the applicable trademark holder. You must request permission to use the Fensak
   logo for promotional purposes. Please [email us](mailto:support@fensak.io) requests to use logos. We reserve
   the right to rescind this permission if you violate these Terms of Service.

5. You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service,
   or access to the Service without the express written permission by Fensak.

10. All content provided to the Service must comply with U.S. copyright law. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
   (17 U.S.C. § 512), you have the right to notify us (Fensak, LLC) if you believe that an account user of any
   product we built and maintain has infringed on your work(s) as copyright owner. To be effective, the notification of
   claimed infringement must be written. Please include the following information:

   * A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that
     is allegedly infringed.

   * Identification of the copyrighted work(s) claimed to have been infringed. If there are multiple, please share a
     representative list of those works.

   * A way for us to locate the material you believe is infringing the copyrighted work.

   * Your name and contact information so that we can get back to you. Email address is preferred but a telephone
     number or mailing address works too.

   * A statement that you, in good faith, believe that use of the material in the manner complained of is not
     authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

   * A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are
     authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

11. If you believe your material has been removed in error, you can file a written
    counter-notification. Please include the following information:

    * A physical or electronic signature, or the signature of the person authorized to act on your behalf.

    * A description of the material that was removed.

    * A description of where the material appeared in Fensak products prior to their removal.

    * Your name and contact information so that we can get back to you. Email address is preferred but a telephone
      number or mailing address works too.

    * A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled
      as a result of mistake or misidentification.

    * A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which
      your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, in the Western District of Texas
      (where Fensak is located).

    * A statement that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice or an agent
      of that person. (In other words, you’ve designated that person to receive documents on your behalf.)

11. You can notify us of either copyright infringement claims or DMCA counter-notifications through either of the
    following channels:

    **By email**: [dmca@fensak.io](mailto:dmca@fensak.io)

    **By mail**: Fensak, LLC ATTN: Yoriyasu Yano 5900 BALCONES DR. STE 100 AUSTIN, TX, 78731, USA


## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:

***You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the Service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.***

In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that’s on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.
