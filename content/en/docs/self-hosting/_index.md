We currently do not officially support running a self-hosted instance of Fensak. What this means is that we do not
make any guarantees, provide official support, or documentation about how to run a self-hosted version of Fensak.

However, since [the source](https://github.com/fensak-io/fensak) is available, there is nothing stopping you from
running a self-hosted version of Fensak, provided you comply with [the licensing
terms](https://github.com/fensak-io/fensak/#license).

To put it simply, you are free to set up a self-hosted instance as long as you can figure it out on your own and you
comply with the license terms.

> **NOTE**
>
> Refer to the [License FAQ](/docs/license-faq) to learn more about the licenses that Fensak employ.
